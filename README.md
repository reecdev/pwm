# pwm
Work in progress

## What is pwm?
pwm (Parallel Worker Manager) is a program that allows you to run agents that operate autonomously and can complete tasks for you.
Note that this is not the same as OpenClaw; OpenClaw is designed to be a general assistant while pwm is designed to run multiple agents in parallel to complete tasks for you while you do other things on your PC.

## Requirements
To run pwm, you will need to install Docker and Ollama on your computer. Currently, only Linux is officialy supported.

# Note: pwm is stil in a very early beta and this readme is incomplete! pwm is currently not reccomended for real use, as it is not production-ready yet.
